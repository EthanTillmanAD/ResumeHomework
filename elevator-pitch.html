Hello, my name is Ethan Tillman. I am currently going through an accelerated program called Year Up United. I am focusing on the application development side of the program. Currently, I am at the top of my class, reinforcing my skills in Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with some prior knowledge of C++ and C#.

Throughout my life, I have always been underestimated by family, friends, and previous employers. I have used this as motivation to prove myself and go above and beyond by working harder than most. I see every new opportunity as a challenge and strive to be the best version of myself and one of the best workers around. When I set my mind to something, there is nothing that will stop me from achieving it.

I constantly think back to a quote from a TV show called Suits, which says, "When someone puts a gun in your face, there are 146 other things you can do to get out of it." I interpret this quote as a reminder that failure is never an option, and I will always find a solution to any problem I am faced with.

This was just a bit about me. Thank you for your time and for checking out my website.
