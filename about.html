        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p id="info">My name is Ethan Tillman and I am currently a student at Year Up United. I've wanted to 
            become a programmer since I was 16 years old. around that time I built my first computer and was 
            immeditly hooked. I spent alot of time trying to figure out who I want to be and desided I want to
            program, my ultimate goal is to someday learn how to develop virtual reality simulations that are 
            for fun and games but also to use them to help develop a system that could help aspiring police, firefighters,
            and medical professions. I am a very quick learner and good with my hands, I enjoy to play video games as well as 
            own a 2021 honda monkey motorcycle, it may be small but I love that bike.
